Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) is used for modern CI/CD workflows as it streamlines and automates the complete software delivery cycle.
It helps in accelerated deployment as it comes with inbuild CI/CD pipelines that automate building, testing and deployement of applications.
It also abstracts the infrastructure layer thereby, removing the environment management complexity. This makes collaboration easier and lowers risk of environment-related problems.
PaaS provides all databases, middleware and APIs, hence helping with fast development and testing in sandbox environments that are very similar to production setups.
PaaS platforms scale resources up and down for managing different levels of traffic automatically therefore ensuring scalability.
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is therefore a cloud computing model that provides a complete, ready-to-use environment for developers. It serves as a middleware layer that manages the underlying infrastructure, including servers, storage, operating systems and networking, freeing developers from these administrative tasks.
PaaS is very cost-efficient as it follows a consumption-based pricing model and users are billed only for the resources they use and services consumed.
PaaS providers invest in robust security measures that include firewalls, encryption, identity and access management and continuous monitoring.
